  "storyText": "<p>Alex felt lost. He worked a job he hated, dated people he didn’t connect with, and generally drifted through life. Then, one rainy afternoon, a strange message flashed across his vision: “New Quest Available: Self-Discovery.” He blinked, thinking he imagined it. “What on earth is happening?” He muttered to himself. This unsettling feeling started after his 25th birthday.</p><div class=\"check-section\"><button class=\"section-check-btn\" onclick=\"checkSection(1)\">Проверить этот раздел</button><div class=\"section-score\" id=\"section-score-1\"></div></div><p>He began noticing patterns. Helping an elderly neighbour gave him +10 to ‘Kindness’ stat. Learning to cook increased his ‘Self-Sufficiency’ skill. He talked to his friend, Maya, about his theory. “You think life is a game?” she asked, skeptically.  “It’s the only thing that makes sense!” Alex replied.</p><div class=\"check-section\"><button class=\"section-check-btn\" onclick=\"checkSection(2)\">Проверить этот раздел</button><div class=\"section-score\" id=\"section-score-2\"></div></div><p>“Okay, let's pretend it is a game,” Maya said.  “What’s your next quest?” Alex thought for a moment. “I want to learn to play the guitar. It’s always been a dream. I believe that will give me a boost to my ‘Creativity’ stat.” He has been practicing every evening for the past month, and is already seeing results.</p><div class=\"check-section\"><button class=\"section-check-btn\" onclick=\"checkSection(3)\">Проверить этот раздел</button><div class=\"section-score\" id=\"section-score-3\"></div></div><p>Alex isn't sure if life actually is a game, but treating it like one has changed everything. He will continue to seek challenging quests; he will explore new skills.  He’s realized that ‘winning’ isn’t about reaching a final level, but about maximizing his experience and enjoying the journey. “I will have completed my biggest quest – living authentically – by the time I turn 30,” he declared confidently.</p><div class=\"check-section\"><button class=\"section-check-btn\" onclick=\"checkSection(4)\">Проверить этот раздел</button><div class=\"section-score\" id=\"section-score-4\"></div></div>",
