  "storyText": "<p>Alex <b>woke up</b> (Past Simple) every morning to the same routine. He <b>goes</b> (Present Simple) to work, <b>eats</b> (Present Simple) the same breakfast, and <b>feels</b> (Present Simple) increasingly…disconnected. One day, during a particularly boring meeting, the world <b>glitched</b> (Past Simple). “What was that?” Alex <b>asked</b> (Past Simple) his colleague, Sarah. “Nothing, Alex. You probably <b>didn't sleep</b> (Past Simple) well,” she replied. But Alex <b>knew</b> (Past Simple) something was different. It <b>felt</b> (Past Simple) like a badly rendered video game.</p><div class=\"check-section\"><button class=\"section-check-btn\" onclick=\"checkSection(1)\">Проверить этот раздел</button><div class=\"section-score\" id=\"section-score-1\"></div></div><p>Suddenly, a message <b>appeared</b> (Past Simple) in his vision: <i>\"Welcome, Player Alex. Life Mode Activated. Understanding Temporal Mechanics is crucial.\"</i> He <b>had never seen</b> (Past Perfect) anything like it!  \"Temporal Mechanics?\" he <b>wondered</b> (Past Simple).  He quickly <b>learned</b> (Past Simple) that temporal mechanics meant understanding verb tenses. The game <b>promised</b> (Past Simple) that mastering them would unlock new abilities. He <b>believed</b> (Past Simple) it was crazy, but what choice did he have?</p><div class=\"check-section\"><button class=\"section-check-btn\" onclick=\"checkSection(2)\">Проверить этот раздел</button><div class=\"section-score\" id=\"section-score-2\"></div></div><p>He <b>has been studying</b> (Present Perfect Continuous) the rules for days, focusing on how actions relate to each other in time.  “If I <b>understand</b> (Present Simple) the past, I can change the present!” he exclaimed.  He realized that by the time he <b>finishes</b> (Future Simple) this level, he <b>will have gained</b> (Future Perfect) the ability to rewind time.  Sarah found him frantically writing on a whiteboard. “What are you doing?” she <b>asks</b> (Present Simple). \"I'm leveling up!\" Alex answered.</p><div class=\"check-section\"><button class=\"section-check-btn\" onclick=\"checkSection(3)\">Проверить этот раздел</button><div class=\"section-score\" id=\"section-score-3\"></div></div><p>He <b>will choose</b> (Future Simple) to use his abilities wisely. He <b>has already decided</b> (Present Perfect) to make his life less…glitchy. One day he <b>will be able to</b> (Future Simple) alter his past, but he understands now that true mastery <b>lies</b> (Present Simple) in accepting the present.  And perhaps, just perhaps, he <b>will unlock</b> (Future Simple) the ultimate secret: that this \"game\" is what he makes of it.</p><div class=\"check-section\"><button class=\"section-check-btn\" onclick=\"checkSection(4)\">Проверить этот раздел</button><div class=\"section-score\" id=\"section-score-4\"></div></div>",
